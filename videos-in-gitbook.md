## Excel <a id="excel"></a>

With aedifion's open source [Excel Plugin](https://github.com/aedifion/aedifion-excel-plugin), you can import data from aedifion.io using its [HTTP API](https://docs.aedifion.io/docs/developers/api-documentation) directly into your Excel sheet. You can query data from multiple datapoints over multiple projects and synchronize asynchronous CoV-based observations with adjustable sample rates and different interpolation methods, such as zero-order-hold \(step interpolation\). The retrieved data can be visualized in different types of automatically generated plots. The plugin is currently available for Windows and can be installed without admin rights.
